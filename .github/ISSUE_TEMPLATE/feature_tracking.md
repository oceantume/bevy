## What does this new feature do?

**NOTE:** please only create tracking issues for features if you're interested in tracking that feature's progress until it is released.
This allows users to quickly find and read a single source of truth for the status of a feature they care about.
For feature requests and early design work, please create a [Discussion](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions) instead, which can then be linked in a tracking issue.

In a short paragraph, describe what the feature does.
Try to focus on the new functionality it allows, rather than the implementation details.
