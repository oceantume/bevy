## What flaw or frustration did you encounter?

Was something inconsistent, surprising or confusing?
Try to provide specific examples if you can.
These could be code snippets, screenshots, a link to a bad error message in our source code, etc.

## What would your ideal solution look like?

Do we need better error messages? Are we missing a function? Is our API unintuitive?
If you have a specific implementation in mind, outline it here.
